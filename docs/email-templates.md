# Email Templates

Design beautiful, effective emails that keep your customers informed.

## Best Practices

- **Be Clear**: State the reason for the email up front.
- **Personalize**: Use dynamic fields like `{customer_name}` and `{order_number}`.
- **Brand Consistency**: Match your store's tone and style.
- **Actionable**: Include links or next steps if needed.

## Dynamic Fields

- `{customer_name}`
- `{order_number}`
- `{product_name}`
- `{shipping_status}`
- ...and more

## Example

```
Hi {customer_name},

Your order {order_number} is now being processed. We'll notify you when it ships!

Thank you for shopping with us.
```
